Yes you heard it right!

To be precise, all the information and code in this repo is compiled and created by me,
and is released under CC SA 3.0, use it, work it, break it as you will.

Found a bug, typo, whatever? File an issue, or even better, send a pull request!

If you found all this useful, feel free to send me a [note of appreciation](hello@flaki.hu)
(open source is hard work, after all!), or you can [PayPal]() me or support my open-source
work at my [Patreon]() as well - your contributions are always welcome and
much appreciated. ðŸ’–

You can also book me for your company/conference/etc. to give a workshop on
progressive webapps, service workers and all these nice and intriguing stuff
above - drop an email to [book+pwa-workshop@skylark.ee](Skylark) and we'll
work something out.
